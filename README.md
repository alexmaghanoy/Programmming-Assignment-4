Submitted by: Alesandra Joyce P. Maghanoy


## OBJECTIVES
1. Learn how to filter and manipulate data to specific data frames.
2. Understand how to apply condition-based filtering to dataset columns.
3. Create proper visualization of data frames using Matlplotlib and Seaborn.


## PROBLEM OVERVIEW

Download the provided ECE Board Exam 2 dataset. By using data wrangling and data visualization techniques with storytelling, analyze the data, and present different: 
- **Data Frames**
- **Visuals**


## PROBLEM 1

**OBJECTIVES**
- Create a filtered data frames based on specific conditions and columns using data wrangling techniques.

**TASK**

*Create the following data frames:*
- Instru = [“Name”, “GEAS”, “Electronics >70”]; where the track is constant as 
Instrumentation and hometown Luzon
- Mindy = [ “Name”, “Track”, “Electronics”, “Average >=55”]; where hometown is 
constant as Mindanao and gender Female

**CODE PROPER**

**SAMPLE TEST RUNS**

## PROBLEM 2

**OBJECTIVES**
- Create visualizations using MatplotLib and Seaborn to show how the different features in the dataset contribute to student's average grades.


**TASK**

*Generate visualizations that will answer and prove the following:*
1. Does the chosen track in college influence a student's average grade?
2. Does gender impact a student's performance on their average grade?
3. Is there any significant  correlation between a student's hometown and the average grade?
   
**CODE PROPER**

**SAMPLE TEST RUNS**
